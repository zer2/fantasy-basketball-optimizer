Identifying mutually beneficial trades can greatly improve fantasy performance. However, the task is non-trivial, especially when trades are numerically asymmetrical. The trading module can help by leveraging H-score to evaluate the effect of the trade on both teams

### Symmetric trade

Symmetric trades are simple to evaluate. There are no choices to be made; the post-trade teams are entirely deterministic. The victory probabilities for each team can be brute-forced based on the means and variances assumed by the H-scoring algorithm

### Asymmetric trade- reducing players
