Many fantasy basketball analysts recommend down-weighting the turnovers category to a low weight like $25\%$ or even $0\%$ . There is a real mathematical argument for doing something like this, but it is overblown. 

## Argument 1: Turnovers are volatile

It is true that turnovers are relatively volatile, and this is relevant for head-to-head. However, they are not uniquely volatile and not so volatile that a $>75/%$ down-weight is warranted 

In 2023, turonvers had 2.37x more week-to-week variance than player-to-player variance. 

## Argument 2: If you are going to win most categories, you will probably lose turnovers no matter what
