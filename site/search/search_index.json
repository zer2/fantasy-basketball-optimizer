They invoke many simplifications, which are helpful both because real fantasy basketball is extremely complex, and because perfect mathematical solutions are not always easy. Because of the simplifications invoked, these methods should in no way be considered the end-all-be-all or truly \"optimal\" in any sense. Rather, they provide one way of thinking about fantasy basketball, out of potentially many. It is also worth noting that the papers have never gone through the peer review process. The logic behind the methods is public; their usefulness is in the eye of the beholder.</p> <p>This documentation provides a guide on how to use and navigate the website. It also provides commentary on the papers where applicable, intended to help users understand the logic behind the methods that are implemented. </p>"},{"location":"gscores/","title":"G-scores","text":"<p>It is well-understood that player value in category leagues is dependent on context. No single number, independent of circumstances around team, opposition, etc. can ever fully define a player's value. However, that has not stopped fantasy enthusiasts from designing and applying so-called 'static' ranking systems. Despite their limitations in theory, they are useful in practice because they are simple and convenient. One ought not let the perfect get in the way of the good. </p> <p>The website uses G-scores as a measure of static value. G-scores are a variant of the traditional Z-score metric, as described in the first paper. While limited in terms of flexibility, they may be helpful for understanding a player's strength and weaknesses, seeing how they relate to other players, and ballparking their overall value. </p>"},{"location":"gscores/#g-score-tab","title":"G-score tab","text":""},{"location":"gscores/#team-tab","title":"Team tab","text":""},{"location":"gscores/#justification","title":"Justification","text":""},{"location":"hscores/","title":"H-scores","text":"<p>H-scoring is a framework introduced in the second paper for dynamic player selection.
