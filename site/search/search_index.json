This is because H-scoring's preferred strategy with SGA involves deprioritizing rebounds with future picks.</p> <p>In later draft rounds, the importance of previously chosen players increases and the importance of the strategy for future picks decreases.

For example, Giannis Antetokounmpo typically is rated poorly according to quantitative metrics, because he is dragged down by poor Free Throw shooting.

One might note that in the case above, the weight for Free Throws is surprisingly high, despite the obvious fact that the algorithm is deprioritizing the category heavily. The reason for this is that in general, H-scoring does not think it needs to adjust weights all that much in order to skew the available candidates to the categories it wants (again, details are in the paper). </p> <p>The flex position allocations show how the algorithm expects to use its flex spots, which can take players of multiple positions.

Per-game values exclude the missing games, while season total values include them as all zeros. The website allows granular control of the spectrum between those two perspectives, plus an additional correction for players being substituted out for replacement players. </p> <p></p> <p>The first factor, \u03c5, scales injury rates on a spectrum between per-game value and season total values. For example if \u03c5 is 0.4 and a player is expected to be injured 10% of the time, that injury rate is adjusted to 4%, and the player's volume projections are multiplied by 96%. A \u03c5 of 0 is equivalent to per-game totals, and a \u03c5 of 1 is equivalent to season total projections. The argument for setting \u03c5 to 1 is that the correct expected value of real player production fully accounts for the probability of injury. The counter-argument is that teams need to be somewhat lucky to have any shot at competing for a championship, so it makes sense for them to strategize with the assumption that their injury luck is reasonably good. The default value for \u03c5 is 1, equivalent to season total values.</p> <p>The second factor, \u03c8, controls an adjustment for replacement players. It is assumed that when a player misses a game, they will be replaced by a replacement-level player for that game \u03c8 of the time, and that is incorporated into projections after they have been adjusted for injury rates. A replacement-level player has the total G-score value of the Nth-highest player, spread across categories, where N is the number of players in the league.  So continuing the previous example, if \u03c8 is 0.75, then 3% times a replacement player's value is added to the player's projection.
