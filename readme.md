[The FSO website](https://fantasy-basketball-optimizer-y9jt7t3ypmiejsyjkeayx6.streamlit.app/) aims to implement the category-based fantasy basketball optimization methods described in my three papers on fantasy basketball. See the [documentation here](https://zer2.github.io/fantasy-basketball-optimizer/).

If you are unfamiliar with fantasy basketball, here are some potentially useful links:
- [*General intro*](https://dunkorthree.com/how-fantasy-basketball-work/)
- [*Scoring formats*](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003913972-Scoring-Formats)
- [*Snake vs auction drafts*](https://www.dummies.com/article/home-auto-hobbies/sports-recreation/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/understanding-fantasy-football-snake-and-auction-drafts-149492/)

If you have any questions about the methods or website please consult the papers, or contact me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/zeros1123). I'm always happy to discuss this work!
