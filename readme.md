[The FSO website](https://fantasy-basketball-optimizer-35667048953.us-east1.run.app/) aims to implement the category-based fantasy basketball optimization methods described in my three papers on fantasy basketball. 

See the [documentation for users here](https://zer2.github.io/fantasy-basketball-optimizer/). It describes how fantasy basketball works, what the papers say, and what the website does. 

For more technical questions please consult the papers, or contact me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/zeros1123). I'm always happy to discuss this work!
