This is the source code for a [website](https://fantasy-basketball-optimizer-35667048953.us-east1.run.app/) which applies algorithms to category-based fantasy basketball. Please note that these algorithms are based on a simplified model of fantasy basketball, and there is no guarantee that using them will lead to success. 

See the documentation for users [here](https://zer2.github.io/fantasy-basketball-optimizer/) for more detailed information. It describes how fantasy basketball works, the logic behind the algorithms, and what the website does. 

For any questions that are not answered in the documentation, feel free to contact me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/zeros1123). I'm always happy to discuss this work!
