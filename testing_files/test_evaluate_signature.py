# testing_files/test_evaluate_signature.py
# Characterization ("golden") test: pins a byte-signature — the sha256 of the fully serialized
# EvaluateResponse — for fixed board states. Any unintended drift in the /evaluate payload is caught
# immediately, in particular the expand-view tables (G-score rows, flex allocations, roster
# assignments) that are built by hand-vectorised code in _build_candidates and serialised through
# stdlib dataclasses. A refactor there that changed a value, a field, ordering, or rounding would
# flip the hash.
#
# This is NOT a correctness test — the benchmark suites already assert H-scores with tolerances.
# This guards SERIALIZATION and hot-path STABILITY: the exact bytes the frontend receives.
#
# The agent's neutral baseline (agent.default_h_scores) is computed once at session build, so every
# evaluate is reproducible from the first call. An empty board short-circuits to that baseline — the
# full-exact, un-throttled solve; a non-empty board runs the position-optimiser throttle primed by it.
#
# Values in the payload are already rounded to 2 dp by the backend, which absorbs sub-0.005 numeric
# jitter, so the hash is stable run-to-run. If you intentionally change the algorithm, data, or
# parameters, regenerate the goldens and paste them into _GOLDEN below:

# sha256 of json.dumps(EvaluateResponse.model_dump(mode='json'), sort_keys=True), keyed by
# (objective, board). Regenerate with UPDATE_EVALUATE_SIGNATURE=1 (see module docstring).
# Regenerated 2026-08-14 for the expand-view diff reattribution: the displayed Future
# diff nets out the opponents' expected future tilts (res['Opponent-Future-Tilt']), so
# Current diff is the board as it stands. Display-only — H-scores verified identical.
#
# Regenerated 2026-08-16 for the Head-to-Head objective dial. Most Categories is untouched (its
# gradient was already exact); Each Category moved because its gradient is now the gradient of the
# objective it returns rather than n_categories times it, which changes how the kappa penalty
# weighs against it. Measured effect: max 0.21 H-score points across the top 40 on an empty
# 2024-25 board, top five unchanged. Half and Half is new.
#
# The 8-category rows were added 2026-08-17 alongside the tiebreaker. Adding them left the nine-
# category hashes below byte-identical, which is the evidence that pricing a tiebreaker into v and
# the G-scores touches nothing in a league that has not named one.
#
# Regenerated 2026-09-05 for the self-play equilibrium overhaul (solve-half complementary
# groups, read-out serve, seed hysteresis, fixed 32-pass budget — commits 5f2a320..01f77bc)
# plus the mean-field high-confidence redesign committed alongside this regen. All rows run at
# the default confidence 0.5, so the drift here comes from the committed equilibrium mechanics,
# not the mean-field mode (which only engages above 0.5).
