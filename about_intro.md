*Hey! This website deals with fantasy basketball. If you are unfamiliar with how it works, here are some useful links*
- [*General intro*](https://dunkorthree.com/how-fantasy-basketball-work/)
- [*Scoring formats*](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003913972-Scoring-Formats)
- [*Snake vs auction drafts*](https://www.dummies.com/article/home-auto-hobbies/sports-recreation/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/understanding-fantasy-football-snake-and-auction-drafts-149492/)

Rankings and algorithms are based on the methods described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02188). A simplified version of the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/zer2/Fantasy-Basketball--in-progress-/blob/main/readme.md). As detailed in the paper, the algorithms all utilize many simplifying assumptions and are not guaranteed to achieve success
