# Welcome to the FBBO Website

The FBBO website implements the methods described in these papers: 

- [Improving algorithms for fantasy basketball](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02188)
- [Dynamic algorithms for fantasy basketball](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09884)
- [Optimizing for Rotisserie fantasy basketball](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00933)

The methods are designed for category leagues (not points leagues). 

Broadly, the papers formulate fantasy basketball as a math problem, and provide methods for selecting players based on that formulation. The methods take projections of player performance as an input. They also invoke many simplifications, which are handy both because real fantasy basketball is extremely complex, and because perfect mathematical solutions are not always easy. Because of the reliance on existing projections and the simplifications invoked, these methods should in no way be considered the end-all-be-all or truly "optimal" in any sense. They are just one potential starting point. 

The website is mostly designed for drafts and auctions. It also provides some related analyses for leagues that are already underway via 'Season Mode'.
